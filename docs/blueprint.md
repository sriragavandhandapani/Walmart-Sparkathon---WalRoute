## Style Guidelines:

- Apply a gradient dark theme as the primary aesthetic.
- Use a gradient from dark blue (#0A2540) to a slightly lighter blue (#0E4771) for the app background.
- Employ a lighter shade of blue (#4A80AD) or white (#FFFFFF) for text and icons to ensure readability against the dark background.
- Use Walmart Blue (#007DC6) as an accent color for interactive elements and highlights, providing brand recognition.
- Continue using 'Inter' sans-serif font for a modern, clean, and easily readable experience. Adjust font weight to ensure readability on the dark background.
- Use clear and recognizable icons from Material Design, optimized for visibility on a dark background (e.g., use filled icons or icons with a subtle glow effect).
- Maintain a tab-based navigation for main sections: Map, Search, Cart, and Recommendations. Adjust the tab bar's style to fit the dark theme, using a semi-transparent background or subtle glow effect.
- Use subtle animations and transitions with consideration for the dark theme, avoiding overly bright or flashy effects. Consider using shadow effects or subtle glows to highlight interactive elements.
